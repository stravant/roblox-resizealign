# Roblox Studio ResizeAlign Plugin

This repository is the source of truth for the Roblox Studio [GeomTools ResizeAlign](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/resizealign-v13-rounded-join-dragger-mode/1815331) plugin.

The repo is open to contributions, though please ping me on the DevForum or Discord first if you plan to implement nontrivial UX changes rather than just fix a bug.

# Contributing

## Get VSCode and Rojo Extension

* Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

* Install the "Rojo - Roblox Studio Sync" extension for VSCode

## Enable "Reload Plugins on File Changed"

* In Studio, open the Studio Settings (File > Studio Settings) 

* Enable "Reload Plugins on File Changed" in the Studio section. This will automatically reload the plugin whenever you build it in VSCode.

## That's it!

Pressing <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+B</kbd> will build the plugin into your local plugins directory using Rojo and Studio will load or reload it in your open Studio sessions.
